I was just lying in bed talking to Tracy about the events of the night that she slept through. 
(cat) George had jumped up on the bed and started a hassle with (older cat) kitsin. I told my her that I had fed the other cats but Queen Mab (kitsin) had gone outside. 
I've never called that cat queen mab. Her name is Leroy Jenkins, but we call her kitsin. I then said "Queen Mab... Queen Mab, that was a fairy queen if I’m not mistaken."
Tracy then said: "I had a dream last night. They were saying Mabus! Mabus! Mabus!" We then discussed and read the Mabus quatrain. 
"I assumed it was about Mrs Mabe" she said “whose full name was Mabus.” "Mrs Mabe’s name was Mabus?" I said. "yes" she said. 
My pronunciation of Queen Mab, was with a long “A” sound like “maybe” rather than like “apple.”  
Tracy is in the habit of discussing her dreams with me, but she has no idea of the likes of Mab, Mebd or nostradamus or quatrains. There were no physical manifestations, no strange feeling no warning, queen mab just came out.  
I read Tracy the portion of the wiki about her being the midwife who helps people give birth to their dreams. Her eyes got big, as if of the sudden implication of the conversation. 
The Mab i was thinking of is more closely aligned with the medb of connacht. That is who I associate when I think of Queen Mab.  
That’s probably why I pronounce it with a long a sound rather than a short a sound.  Some convolution of Medb, and Mab.  
Im sure on some level I am familiar with shakespere's mab, having read R&J several times.  
I can think of nothing recently that primed the conversation, dream, or my calling kitsin queen mab (Medb).

Initial reflection: 5/2/2025 ~6:00 AM
Event occurrence: 5/3/2025 ~9:30 AM
Event Description:
On 5/2/2025 around 6 AM, I reviewed the emergency fall-over procedure for the Asterix VoIP server in a documentation binder that I rarely ever look at. 
This binder exists for disaster recovery and is not part of my daily or even monthly work.  It was on my desk because I had given it to Andy the day before, as he needed the IP list
for the surveillance cameras to set up a new monitor in the office.  Looking through it was nostalgic, like looking over your old journal entries or something.  
The section I reviewed was specifically about initiating the backup VOIP server in case of failure.
While looking at it, I thought: “11 years, running that secondhand Dell 2970 and never had to fall over to the backup server.”
Roughly 27 hours later, on 5/3/2025 at ~9:30 AM, I received a call that the phones were down. I discovered that the Asterix server (Dell 2970) had experienced a hardware failure (E1000). 
No one had accessed or touched this machine recently, and only I know how to maintain it. I used the exact fall-over procedure I had reviewed the previous morning.
Phenomenological Notes:
•	My review of the binder was not prompted by any suspicion of failure.
•	The Dell server has run consistently for 11 years with no prior failover.
•	Felt like an idle thought, not a premonition, but the precision is uncanny.
•	The timing, specificity, and relevance are unusually aligned.
